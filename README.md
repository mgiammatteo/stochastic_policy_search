# Hill Climbing

This repository contains the implementation of the following stochastic policy search algorithms:
* Vanilla hill climbing
* Hill climbing with simulated annealing
* Steepest ascent hill climbing with adaptive noise scaling

They are all applied to the OpenAi Gym Cartpole-v0 environment, for simplicity.
